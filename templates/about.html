    <h2><b>About the author Jim Ryan</b></h2>
    <p>
    <b>Howdy there!</b> Welcome aboard. I'm Jim Ryan, but folks around here call me all sorts of things.  Like many Jim, I picked up photography and cookin' all on my own. Back in 2021, I started this here blog and named it after my favorite food, Sinigang. Now we're settled in Manaoag City, workin' on this blog part-time. Let me tell you, it don't get much better than this!
    </p>
    <p>
        Food? That's my obsession. Dreamin' up new recipes, devourin' cookbooks, keepin' up on food and health news - it's all part of the fun. And takin' pictures of it all? Well, that's just the icing on the cake, I hope it gets you inspired to whip up somethin' tasty and good for you in your own kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of all, I love eatin' good food with good company. There ain't nothin' better than that, is there? I reckon cookin' should be a joy and recipes ain't set in stone. I mostly leave the meat out of my dishes here on SinigangSanctuary's Kitchen, but that don't mean there ain't room for a treat now and then. Laughter and good company over a drink or two? You betcha!
    </p>
    <p>
        This blog is all about celebratin' good food - real, down-to-earth food that tickles your taste buds and keeps you healthy. So, come on in, grab a seat, and let's get cookin'!
