    <h2 class="text-slate-100">In Munich: Käsespätzle
</h2>
    <p class="sm:text-2xl dark:text-slate-100">
    Continuing my culinary journey through Munich, Germany, I have to tell you all about a dish that surprised and delighted me: Käsespätzle. Now, the name might sound a little intimidating, but trust me, this dish is pure comfort food heaven.
        <br>
        Imagine soft, pillowy egg noodles, tossed in a creamy, melted cheese sauce.  That's Käsespätzle in a nutshell.  The spätzle themselves were a revelation. Unlike any pasta I'd ever had, they were small, irregular dumplings with a delightful chewiness.  They provided the perfect base for the rich and decadent cheese sauce.
        <br>
        <br>
        The specific Käsespätzle I had at a charming little restaurant called Zum Schneider was pure magic.  They used a combination of cheeses, including Emmentaler and Gruyere, which created a complex and satisfying flavor profile.  The cheese wasn't overpowering, but it clung perfectly to the spätzle, coating them in a blanket of cheesy goodness.
        <br>
        <br>
        The beauty of Käsespätzle is its simplicity. This dish doesn't need a lot of fanfare.  At Zum Schneider, it came with a side of caramelized onions, which added a touch of sweetness and a delightful savory contrast.  It was the perfect accompaniment, but honestly, the spätzle and cheese were so good on their own, they could have stood alone.
        <br>
        Of course, no German meal is complete without a good beer, and this cheesy delight was no exception.  I opted for a local helles lager, which was light and crisp, perfectly cutting through the richness of the cheese sauce.  It was a match made in Bavarian heaven.
        <br>
        <br>
        This wasn't just a plate of food; it was a warm hug on a cool Munich evening.  The cozy atmosphere of Zum Schneider, the friendly service, and that incredible Käsespätzle – it was an experience I won't soon forget.
        <br>
        So, if you're ever in Munich with a hankering for something cheesy and comforting, put Käsespätzle on your list.  And if you find yourself at Zum Schneider, you're in for a real treat.  This dish is a cheesy masterpiece, and a memory I'll be savoring until my next German adventure.

            <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>1 batch Homemade German Spätzle (about 5 cups cooked Spätzle, can use store-bought if preferred), can be made in advance and refrigerated until ready use, then let warm to room temperature before baking.</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2-3 large onions , chopped (the more caramelized onions the better so I go with at least 3!)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>12 ounces shredded Emmentaler or Jarlsberg (Swiss-like from Norway, mild) (you can also add some Gruyere for extra flavor)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>RECIPIES</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter a 9x13 (or a little smaller) casserole dish.</li>
                <li>To make the caramelized onions: Melt the butter in a medium-sized heavy stock pot or Dutch oven. Add the onions and stir occasionally for 20-30 minutes until deeply caramelized.  Halfway into it sprinkle with a little salt and sugar to help with the caramelizing. Get the onions nice and brown.</li>
                <li>Layer 1/3 of the Spätzle in the bottom of the dish followed by 1/3 of the cheese and 1/3 of the caramelized onions. Repeat, sprinkling each layer with some salt, ending with cheese and onions on top.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10 minutes or longer until the cheese is melted and the edges are just beginning to get a little crispy.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately. This makes great leftovers!</li>
